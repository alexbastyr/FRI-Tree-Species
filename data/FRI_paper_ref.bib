   abstract = {The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is a 14-channel imaging instrument operating on NASA&rsquo;s Terra satellite since 1999. ASTER&rsquo;s visible&ndash;near infrared (VNIR) instrument, with three bands and a 15 m Instantaneous field of view (IFOV), is accompanied by an additional band using a second, backward-looking telescope. Collecting along-track stereo pairs, the geometry produces a base-to-height ratio of 0.6. In August 2019, the ASTER Science Team released Version 3 of the global DEM (GDEM) based on stereo correlation of 1.8 million ASTER scenes. The DEM has 1 arc-second latitude and longitude postings (~30 m) and employed cloud masking to avoid cloud-contaminated pixels. Custom software was developed to reduce or eliminate artifacts found in earlier GDEM versions, and to fill holes due to the masking. Each 1&times;1 degree GDEM tile was manually inspected to verify the completeness of the anomaly removal, which was generally excellent except across some large ice sheets. The GDEM covers all of the Earth&rsquo;s land surface from 83 degrees north to 83 degrees south latitude. This is a unique, global high spatial resolution digital elevation dataset available to all users at no cost. In addition, a second unique dataset was produced and released. The raster-based ASTER Global Water Body Dataset (ASTWBD) identifies the presence of permanent water bodies, and marks them as ocean, lake, or river. An accompanying DEM file indicates the elevation for each water pixel. To date, over 100 million 1&times;1 degree GDEM tiles have been distributed.},

   abstract = {Dense time series of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery are creating exciting new opportunities to monitor, map, and characterize temporal dynamics in land surface properties with unprecedented spatial detail and quality. By combining imagery from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and the MultiSpectral Instrument on-board Sentinel-2A and -2B, the remote sensing community now has access to moderate (10–30 m) spatial resolution imagery with repeat periods of ~3 days in the mid-latitudes. At the same time, the large combined data volume from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 introduce substantial new challenges for users. Land surface phenology (LSP) algorithms, which estimate the timing of phenophase transitions and quantify the nature and magnitude of seasonality in remotely sensed land surface conditions, provide an intuitive way to reduce data volumes and redundancy, while also furnishing data sets that are useful for a wide range of applications including monitoring ecosystem response to climate variability and extreme events, ecosystem modelling, crop-type discrimination, and land cover, land use, and land cover change mapping, among others. To support the need for operational LSP data sets, here we describe a continental-scale land surface phenology algorithm and data product based on harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery. The algorithm creates high quality times series of vegetation indices from HLS imagery, which are then used to estimate the timing of vegetation phenophase transitions at 30 m spatial resolution. We present results from assessment efforts evaluating LSP retrievals, and provide examples illustrating the character and quality of information related to land cover and terrestrial ecosystem properties provided by the continental LSP dataset that we have developed. The algorithm is highly successful in ecosystems with strong seasonal variation in leaf area (e.g., deciduous forests). Conversely, results in evergreen systems are less interpretable and conclusive.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

In a 17 year longitudinal study of vegetation remeasurements at eight sites in north-central and west-central British Columbia (BC), we assessed responses of terrestrial caribou forage lichen abundances to nine forest harvesting treatments and one prescribed burn 8&ndash;14 years following treatment, as well as to MPB attack. Overall, after initially declining following forest harvesting, mean forage lichen abundance increased between 1 and 2 years post-harvest and 13 and 14 years post-harvest at 10 of 11 site/treatment combinations. Mean forage lichen abundance decreased following MPB attack at all sites. Biophysical factors influencing rates of lichen recovery post-disturbance include site type (transitional vs. edaphic), a reduction in favourable conditions for moss recovery, level of MPB attack, and both seasonal timing and method of forest harvesting. When considering effects of forest harvesting on forage lichens, objectives of silvicultural management strategies should focus on protecting and retaining terrestrial lichens at edaphic sites and on re-establishing terrestrial lichens at transitional sites.},

   abstract = {Since the mountain pine beetle (MPB) breached the Rocky Mountains and first appeared in the province of Alberta, Canada, in alarming numbers in the summer of 2005, it has spread eastward across Alberta at an average rate of 80 km/year. In the absence of aggressive control, the beetle will undoubtedly continue to spread eastward. The spread rate is expected to slow as the leading edge invasion front moves further from significant population sources in the dense pine of the Rocky Mountain foothills into the scattered pine of the boreal plains region. However, the realized rate of spread is uncertain, as it will be regulated by a number of factors, some of which are uncertain (e.g. how an insect behaves in a novel environment), inherently unpredictable (e.g. weather), or under human control (e.g. spread control efforts). Whereas previous studies have examined factors affecting spread individually, we present a synthetic framework that models future spread rates as a function of coupled nonlinear recruitment dynamics that arise from the distinct population phases of MPB, and correlated thermal response functions that are characteristic of the influence of climate and climate change on ecosystem processes. We analyzed the model's behavior under two climatic driving scenarios (drying climate and warming climate) and one forest health scenario (an increase in the ratio of stressed to vigorous trees), with the hypothesis that these scenarios would produce unanticipated outcomes in the severity and timing of beetle outbreaks. Our results showed a classic “tipping-point” model capable of generating sudden, unanticipated behavior, demonstrating that MPB populations may respond very strongly to small changes in climate. The MPB may be the first of many systems to behave in unprecedented ways. The model makes clear that the eastward rate of spread will depend on whether, when, and where the system transitions from the current epidemic state to a new endemic state. However, major uncertainties in the system limit our ability to make robust predictions of spread under natural conditions. The integrating framework presented here provides insight into scientific uncertainties worth targeting for applied research into spread management. In the absence of ability to predict beetle spread, forest management should continue to explore ways of coping with unpredictable disturbances, including adaptive capacity to adjust to transformational ecosystem changes expected under climate change.},

   abstract = {Summary 1 Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2 This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3 Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4 The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

   abstract = {Spatially explicit information on tree species composition of managed and natural forests, plantations and urban vegetation provides valuable information for nature conservationists as well as for forest and urban managers and is frequently required over large spatial extents. Over the last four decades, advances in remote sensing technology have enabled the classification of tree species from several sensor types. While studies using remote sensing data to classify and map tree species reach back several decades, a recent review on the status, potentials, challenges and outlooks in this realm is missing. Here, we search for major trends in remote sensing techniques for tree species classification and discuss the effectiveness of different sensors and algorithms based on a literature review. This review demonstrates that the number of studies focusing on tree species classification has increased constantly over the last four decades and promising local scale approaches have been presented for several sensor types. However, there are few examples for tree species classifications over large geographic extents, and bridging the gap between current approaches and tree species inventories over large geographic extents is still one of the biggest challenges of this research field. Furthermore, we found only few studies which systematically described and examined the traits that drive the observed variance in the remote sensing signal and thereby enable or hamper species classifications. Most studies followed data-driven approaches and pursued an optimization of classification accuracy, while a concrete hypothesis or a targeted application was missing in all but a few exceptional studies. We recommend that future research efforts focus stronger on the causal understanding of why tree species classification approaches work under certain conditions or – maybe even more important - why they do not work in other cases. This might require more complex field acquisitions than those typically used in the reviewed studies. At the same time, we recommend reducing the number of purely data-driven studies and algorithm-benchmarking studies as these studies are of limited value, especially if the experimental design is limited, e.g. the tree population is not representative and only a few sensors or acquisition settings are simultaneously investigated.},

   abstract = {Caribou (Rangifer tarandus (L., 1758)) play a central role in the ecology and culture of much of Canada, where they were once the most abundant cervid. Most populations are currently declining, and some face extirpation. In southern Canada, caribou range has retreated considerably over the past century. The ultimate reason for their decline is habitat alterations by industrial activities. The proximate causes are predation and, to a lesser extent, overharvest. The most southerly populations of "Mountain" caribou are at imminent risk of extirpation. Mountain caribou are threatened by similar industrial activities as Boreal caribou, and face increasing harassment from motorized winter recreational activities. Most populations of "Migratory Tundra" caribou are currently declining. Although these caribou fluctuate in abundance over decades, changing harvest technologies, climate change, increasing industrial development and human presence in the North raise doubts over whether recent declines will be followed by recoveries. The Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi J.A. Allen, 1902), a distinct subspecies endemic to Canada's High Arctic, has suffered drastic declines caused by severe weather, hunting and predation. It faces an increasing threat from climate change. While some questions remain about the reasons for the decline of Migratory Tundra caribou, research has clearly identified several threats to the persistence of "Boreal", Mountain, and Peary caribou. Scientific knowledge, however, has neither effectively influenced policies nor galvanized public opinion sufficiently to push governments into effective actions. The persistence of many caribou populations appears incompatible with the ongoing pace of industrial development.},

   abstract = {Vegetation structure is identified as an important biodiversity indicator providing the physical environment that generates, supports, and maintains forest biodiversity. Airborne lidar systems (light detection and ranging) have the capacity to accurately measure three-dimensional vegetation structure, and have been widely used in wildlife habitat mapping and species distribution modeling. Large–area structural inventories using lidar-derived variables that characterize generic habitat structure have rarely been done, yet would be helpful for guiding biodiversity monitoring and conservation assessments of species at regional levels. This study provides a novel approach for processing regional-scale lidar data into categorical classes representing natural groupings of habitat structure. We applied cluster analysis on six lidar-derived habitat-related variables to classify vegetation structure into eight classes for the forested areas of ten natural subregions in boreal and foothill forests in Alberta, Canada. Structure classes were compared across different natural subregions and under anthropogenic/non-anthropogenic disturbance regimes. We found that the Lower Foothills Natural Subregions had the most complex vegetation structure, and wildfire was the most prevalent disturbance agent for all classes except for the rarest class (i.e. stands with high standard deviations of height and low canopy cover) which was more heavily altered by timber harvesting. This data product provides continuous, regional mapping of vegetation structure directly measured from lidar, with a spatial resolution (30m) relatively finer than what was provided by polygon-based forest inventories. This vegetation structure classification and its associated spatial distribution address the fundamental issue of habitat structure in biodiversity monitoring. It can serve as a base layer used together with species and land cover data for forest resources planning, species distribution and animal movement modeling, as well as prioritization of conservation efforts on critical habitat structures.},

Because of the high spatial and temporal resolution, Sentinel-2 time series improve the characterization of vegetation phenology and canopy structure, parameters that are intrinsically linked to tree species. The objective of this study was to test the utility of a Sentinel-2 time-series based approach for mapping tree species in a temperate forest region in Central Europe. Using stand-wise forest inventory data for single species stands we assess how well main and minor tree species can be mapped, and if the addition of environmental variables and spatial texture metrics improves the classification accuracy. Our time series approach utilizes all available Sentinel-2 observations and an ensemble of radial basis convolution filters to build cloud-free 5-day time series for each spectral band. The time series are then used as input features to classify seventeen tree species. Our results show the potential of Sentinel-2 time-series based classification, but they also show the challenges associated with mapping a diverse portfolio of tree species. Accuracy of the nine main species, with an area proportion greater than 0.5%, ranged between 98.9% and 66.8%, which is promising for a large area. Adding detailed environmental data and texture metrics to the spectral model only marginally increased the accuracy of a few minor tree species. Overall, the eight minor tree species with area proportions less than 0.5% were most strongly affected by classification errors. Although the absolute mapped area of minor species correlated well with the estimated reference area, the small class areas of minor species lead to high classification errors in relative terms. Mapping minor tree species is challenging for statistical reasons (i.e., class imbalance, small sample size and class variance). Using all available Sentinel-2 data allows building dense time series at high spatial resolution that are mandatory for improved tree species mapping. We were able to show that the spectral time series is the prime explanatory information, even when complementing our analyses with texture information and various environmental data. The results suggest that with the applied data harmonization approach precise regional tree species mapping is feasible.},

   abstract = {The examination of annual, gap-free, surface reflectance, image composites over large areas, made possible by free and open access to Landsat imagery, allows for the capture of both stand replacing and non-stand-replacing forest change. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal information extracted from the time-series data enables the attribution of various forest change types over large areas. In this paper we apply spectral trend analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data from 1984 to 2012 to detect, characterize, and attribute forest changes in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Change detection is performed using breakpoint analysis of the spectral trends and change events are characterized using a set of metrics derived from an image time series that relate the temporal, spectral, and geometrical properties on an object basis. Change objects are attributed to a change type (i.e., fire, harvesting, road, and non-stand-replacing changes) using a Random Forest classifier. Non-stand-replacing changes are generally low magnitude, punctual, trend anomalies that relate year-on-year ephemeral changes that do not lead to a change in land cover class (i.e., phenology, insects, water stress). The results confirm that land cover changes are detected with high overall accuracy (92.2%), with the majority of changes labeled to the correct occurrence year (91.1%) or within ±1year (98.7%). Characterization of changes enables accurate attribution both at the object (91.6%) and area levels (98%), with fire and harvesting events the most successfully attributed (commission error<10%), and roads, the most challenging to attribute correctly (commission error>13%). Our approach, prototyped over the forested area of Saskatchewan, has enabled a highly automated and systematic depiction of a 30-year history of forest change, providing otherwise unavailable insights on disturbance trends including spatial, temporal, and categorical characteristics. The generation and application of metrics that relate a range of change characteristics allow for depiction of a broad range of change events, types, and conditions.},

   abstract = {Mapping and monitoring land cover and land cover change remains a top priority for land managers. Uniquely, remote sensing offers the capacity to acquire information in a systematic (spatially, temporally, and categorically) and synoptic fashion that is appealing from monitoring and reporting perspectives. The opening of the Landsat archive and new processing and analysis opportunities enable the characterization of large areas and the generation of dynamic, transparent, systematic, repeatable, and spatially exhaustive information products. Best Available Pixel (BAP) approaches enable the production of periodic image composites free of haze, clouds, or shadows over large areas. In this paper we demonstrate an integrated protocol to produce spatially exhaustive annual BAP image composites that are seasonally constrained and free of atmospheric perturbations. These annual BAP composites for the years inclusive of 1998 to 2010 provide for generation of a suite of change metrics for the period 2000 to 2010 using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data. The study area is the >375,000km2 forested area of Saskatchewan, Canada. We evaluate the robustness of the protocol by comparing in-filled (or proxy) values with a true reference set for surface reflectance. An initial change detection pass is used to aid in the allocation of proxy values (for missing and anomalous values) and to allocate change events to the correct year, with a second pass to characterize key change points and related time series trends (e.g., change year, post-change slopes, among others). In so doing, a multi-temporal data cube (via a series of annual proxy composites) and a set of change metrics are generated. Approximately 35% of the pixels in our study area required proxy values, either as a result of missing data or our noise detection approach. Overall, our results indicate strong agreement between the assigned proxy values and the reference data (R=0.71–0.91, RMSE=0.008–0.025). Agreement was stronger for pixel series with no change events (R=0.73–0.92, RMSE=0.007–0.024), relative to pixel series with change events (R=0.63–0.87, RMSE=0.010–0.029). The generated change metrics, derived via temporal and spatial analysis of the annual BAP composites, were an important precursor to the generation of valid proxy values, and – importantly – provide valuable information for the further assessment and understanding of land cover and land cover change. Our results indicate that the demonstrated protocol provides a reliable approach to generate proxy image composites containing no data gaps, along with a suite of informative change metrics that provide a comprehensive characterization of land cover changes (including disturbance and recovery) allowing for an improved understanding of landscape dynamics. The protocol is efficient and may be applied over large areas to support regional and national mapping and monitoring activities.},

   abstract = {Habitat alteration caused by forest harvesting seems to contribute to the decline of forest-dwelling caribou, an ecotype of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) inhabiting the boreal ecosystem. To serve as basework to the establishment of conservation measures for the species, we have studied the hierarchical habitat selection of forest-dwelling caribou in a boreal landscape of Québec strongly impacted by logging. Fifteen females were surveyed by GPS telemetry between April 2004 and March 2006. Home ranges showed a high proportion of 90–120 year-old forests, a low proportion of regenerating forests (20–40 years old) and a tendency to include a greater proportion of 6–20 year-old clearcuts in relation to their availability in the study area. At the home range scale, selection patterns differed between periods, possibly reflecting specific requirements linked to caribou life cycle. Caribou selected open lichen woodlands throughout the year while mature closed forests (≥50 years) were selected uniquely during summer. The 6–20 year-old clearcuts were avoided during calving, in summer and during the rutting period but were selected during spring. Our results indicate that mature forest and open lichen woodlands are highly selected forest cover types by caribou at both spatial scales. Although clearcuts were generally avoided at the home range scale, such avoidance was not observed at the larger scale, the search for 90–120 year-old forests being hampered by a uniform distribution of clearcuts. An a posteriori landscape analysis highlighted the spatial association between 6–20 year-old clearcuts and 90–120 year-old forests, an association that can be explained by the current regulations used in Québec. Our results underline the importance of pursuing research concerning the impact of such an exploitation regime on the long-term maintenance of the forest caribou in the boreal landscape.},

Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations.},

It is, for example, important for issues such as wildlife habitat modeling and close-to-nature forest management. We examined the suitability of 8-band WorldView-2 satellite data for the identification of 10 tree species in a temperate forest in Austria. We performed a Random Forest (RF) classification (object-based and pixel-based) using spectra of manually delineated sunlit regions of tree crowns. The overall accuracy for classifying 10 tree species was around 82% (8 bands, object-based). The class-specific producer’s accuracies ranged between 33% (European hornbeam) and 94% (European beech) and the user’s accuracies between 57% (European hornbeam) and 92% (Lawson’s cypress). The object-based approach outperformed the pixel-based approach. We could show that the 4 new WorldView-2 bands (Coastal, Yellow, Red Edge, and Near Infrared 2) have only limited impact on classification accuracy if only the 4 main tree species (Norway spruce, Scots pine, European beech, and English oak) are to be separated. However, classification accuracy increased significantly using the full spectral resolution if further tree species were included. Beside the impact on overall classification accuracy, the importance of the spectral bands was evaluated with two measures provided by RF. An in-depth analysis of the RF output was carried out to evaluate the impact of reference data quality and the resulting reliability of final class assignments. Finally, an extensive literature review on tree species classification comprising about 20 studies is presented.},

In direct marketing, data mining has been used extensively to identify potential customers for a new product. Using historical purchase data, a predictive response model with data mining techniques is developed to predict a probability that a customer is going to respond to a promotion or an offer. The purpose of this study is to identify the bank customers who are more likely to respond positively to a new product offering. To achieve this purpose, a predictive response model was built. For the purpose of modeling customers’ data were gathered from one of the Iranian banks. RFM features and their two-way interactions were constructed. Feature selection was carried out to determine the inputs to the model. Also undersampling was used for solving class imbalance problem. Finally SVM was used as a classifier for classification purpose. The result indicates that the company can reach three times as many respondents as if they use no model for target selection and this could be very beneficial for the bank; it can maximize customers' response to a product offering, minimize the overall marketing cost, and improve customer relationship management.},

   abstract = {We introduce and test LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery), a new approach to extract spectral trajectories of land surface change from yearly Landsat time-series stacks (LTS). The method brings together two themes in time-series analysis of LTS: capture of short-duration events and smoothing of long-term trends. Our strategy is founded on the recognition that change is not simply a contrast between conditions at two points in time, but rather a continual process operating at both fast and slow rates on landscapes. This concept requires both new algorithms to extract change and new interpretation tools to validate those algorithms. The challenge is to resolve salient features of the time series while eliminating noise introduced by ephemeral changes in illumination, phenology, atmospheric condition, and geometric registration. In the LandTrendr approach, we use relative radiometric normalization and simple cloud screening rules to create on-the-fly mosaics of multiple images per year, and extract temporal trajectories of spectral data on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We then apply temporal segmentation strategies with both regression-based and point-to-point fitting of spectral indices as a function of time, allowing capture of both slowly-evolving processes, such as regrowth, and abrupt events, such as forest harvest. Because any temporal trajectory pattern is allowable, we use control parameters and threshold-based filtering to reduce the role of false positive detections. No suitable reference data are available to assess the role of these control parameters or to test overall algorithm performance. Therefore, we also developed a companion interpretation approach founded on the same conceptual framework of capturing both long and short-duration processes, and developed a software tool to apply this concept to expert interpretation and segmentation of spectral trajectories (TimeSync, described in a companion paper by Cohen et al., 2010). These data were used as a truth set against which to evaluate the behavior of the LandTrendr algorithms applied to three spectral indices. We applied the LandTrendr algorithms to several hundred points across western Oregon and Washington (U.S.A.). Because of the diversity of potential outputs from the LTS data, we evaluated algorithm performance against summary metrics for disturbance, recovery, and stability, both for capture of events and longer-duration processes. Despite the apparent complexity of parameters, our results suggest a simple grouping of parameters along a single axis that balances the detection of abrupt events with capture of long-duration trends. Overall algorithm performance was good, capturing a wide range of disturbance and recovery phenomena, even when evaluated against a truth set that contained new targets (recovery and stability) with much subtler thresholds of change than available from prior validation datasets. Temporal segmentation of the archive appears to be a feasible and robust means of increasing information extraction from the Landsat archive.},

Models from each technique were applied across the 20+ year Landsat time-series to derive biomass trajectories, to which a curve-fitting algorithm was applied to leverage the temporal information contained within the time-series itself and to minimize error associated with exogenous effects such as biomass measurements, phenology, sun angle, and other sources. The effect of curve-fitting was an improvement in predictions of biomass change when validated against observed biomass change from repeat FIA inventories. Maps of biomass dynamics were integrated with maps depicting the location and timing of forest disturbance and regrowth to assess the biomass consequences of these processes over large areas and long time frames. The application of these techniques to a large sample of Landsat scenes across North America will facilitate spatial and temporal estimation of biomass dynamics associated with forest disturbance and regrowth, and aid in national-level estimates of biomass change in support of the North American Carbon Program.},

   abstract = {The gap between research and its implementation is an impediment to conservation of the environment. Translating science into actionable management and policy requires effective communication and collaboration among scientists, practitioners, and policy-makers. Ecologists routinely rely on spatial data to describe wildlife distributions; however, habitat definitions vary by species, and data sources often differ from those used by land managers. Finding commonalities in the language and data used to plan for industrial activities and wildlife conservation may help address the research-implementation gap for threatened species like woodland caribou. We built resource selection functions for caribou using Alberta Vegetation Index (AVI) habitat data, which is employed by the Alberta forest industry for landbase planning. Our goal was to bridge the research-implementation gap by providing the forest industry with tools to facilitate planning for caribou conservation within their jurisdiction. In contrast to previous studies that highlighted shortcomings in AVI data for predicting wildlife habitat use, we found that resource selection function models that combined AVI data with complementary covariates validated well to predict caribou habitat use. We suggest that by using a data source familiar to land managers, ecologists can facilitate the bridging of the research-implementation gap without compromising the quality of ecological modeling.},

   abstract = {Forest fires are the most dominant natural disturbance process influencing the habitat and distribution of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in winter. This is a function of terrestrial lichens, the primary winter forage of caribou, taking decades to recover following fire. Working across the range of the Klaza caribou herd in the west-central Yukon, Canada, we used statistical count models to evaluate variation in lichen volume and percent cover among burns of different age classes. Burns of the same age had considerable variation in lichen abundance. Forage lichens were more abundant in coniferous stands with greater canopy openness, tree height, and basal area. Although not a significant parameter in models of volume or percent cover of lichen, time since burn improved model performance. Relative to thresholds in the published literature, most stands had sufficient lichen at 50 years post fire to be considered winter range for caribou. The relationship between caribou and burned landscapes is complex suggesting that wildlife and forest managers should look beyond burn age when accounting for the effects of fire on the availability and quality of winter habitat for woodland caribou.},

   abstract = {Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) (MPB) outbreaks are increasingly prevalent in western North America, causing considerable ecological change in pine (Pinus spp.) forests with important implications for wildlife. We reviewed studies examining wildlife responses to MPB outbreaks and postoutbreak salvage logging to inform forest management and guide future research. Our review included 16 studies describing MPB outbreak relationships with 89 bird species and 6 studies describing relationships with 11 mammalian species, but no studies of reptiles or amphibians. We included studies that compared wildlife response metrics temporally (before versus after the outbreak) and spatially (across sites that varied in severity of outbreak) in relation to beetle outbreaks. Outbreaks ranged in size from 20,600 to 107 ha and studies occurred 1-30 years after the peak MPB outbreak, but most studies were conducted over the short-term (i.e., <6 years after the peak of MPB-induced tree mortality). Birds were the only taxa studied frequently; however, high variability existed among those studies to allow many inferences, although some patterns were evident. Avian studies concluded that cavity-nesting species responded more favorably to beetle-killed forests than species with open-cup nests, and species nesting in the shrub layer favored outbreak forests compared with ground and open-cup canopy nesters that generally showed mixed relationships. Bark-drilling species as a group clearly demonstrated a positive short-term association with MPB epidemics compared with that of other foraging assemblages. Cavity-nesting birds that do not consume bark beetles (i.e., secondary cavity-nesting species and nonbark-drilling woodpeckers) also exhibited some positive responses to MPB outbreaks, although not as pronounced or consistent as those of bark-drilling woodpeckers. Mammalian responses to MPB outbreaks were mixed. Studies consistently reported negative effects of MPB outbreaks on red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). However, there is evidence that red squirrels can persist after an outbreak under some conditions, e.g., when nonhost tree species are present. For small mammal species associated with forest understories, responses may be most pronounced during the postepidemic period (>6 years after the peak of beetle-induced tree mortality) when snags fall to produce coarse woody debris. Postoutbreak salvage logging studies (n = 6) reported results that lacked consensus. Postoutbreak salvage logging may have an impact on fewer wildlife species than postfire salvage logging, probably because only host-specific tree species are removed after beetle outbreaks. © 2014 Society of American Foresters.},

   abstract = {Up-to-date forest inventory information relating the characteristics of managed and natural forests is fundamental to sustainable forest management and required to inform conservation of biodiversity and assess climate change impacts and mitigation opportunities. Strategic forest inventories are difficult to compile over large areas and are often quickly outdated or spatially incomplete as a function of their long production cycle. As a consequence, automated approaches supported by remotely sensed data are increasingly sought to provide exhaustive spatial coverage for a set of core attributes in a timely fashion. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the integration of current remotely-sensed data products and pre-existing jurisdictional inventory data to map four forest attributes of interest (stand age, dominant species, site index, and stem density) for a 55 Mha study region in British Columbia, Canada. First, via image segmentation, spectrally homogenous objects were derived from Landsat surface-reflectance pixel composites. Second, a suite of Landsat-based predictors (e.g., spectral indices, disturbance history, and forest structure) and ancillary variables (e.g., geographic, topographic, and climatic) were derived for these units and used to develop predictive models of target attributes. For the often difficult classification of dominant species, two modelling approaches were compared: (a) a global Random Forests model calibrated with training samples collected over the entire study area, and (b) an ensemble of local models, each calibrated with spatially constrained local samples. Accuracy assessment based upon independent validation samples revealed that the ensemble of local models was more accurate and efficient for species classification, achieving an overall accuracy of 72% for the species which dominate 80% of the forested areas in the province. Results indicated that site index had the highest agreement between predicted and reference (R2 = 0.74, %RMSE = 23.1%), followed by stand age (R2 = 0.62, %RMSE = 35.6%), and stem density (R2 = 0.33, %RMSE = 65.2%). Inventory attributes mapped at the image-derived unit level captured much finer details than traditional polygon-based inventory, yet can be readily reassembled into these larger units for strategic forest planning purposes. Based upon this work, we conclude that in a multi-source forest monitoring program, spatially localized and detailed characterizations enabled by time series of Landsat observations in conjunction with ancillary data can be used to support strategic inventory activities over large areas.},

The radiance variables evaluated included the red and photographic infrared (IR) radiance and the linear combinations of the IR/red ratio, the square root of the IR/red ratio, the IR-red difference, the vegetation index, and the transformed vegetation index. In addition, the corresponding green and red linear combinations were evaluated for comparative purposes. Three data sets were used from June, September, and October sampling periods. Regression analysis showed the increased utility of the IR and red linear combinations vis-à-vis the same green and red linear combinations. The red and IR linear combinations had 7% and 14% greater regression significance than the green and red linear combinations for the June and September sampling periods, respectively. The vegetation index, transformed vegetation index, and square root of the IR/red ratio were the most significant, followed closely by the IR/red ratio. Less than a 6% difference separated the highest and lowest of these four ER and red linear combinations. The use of these linear combinations was shown to be sensitive primarily to the green leaf area or green leaf biomass. As such, these linear combinations of the red and photographic IR radiances can be employed to monitor the photosynthetically active biomass of plant canopies.},

   abstract = {The U.S. Geological Survey’s Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) initiative is a new end-to-end capability to continuously track and characterize changes in land cover, use, and condition to better support research and applications relevant to resource management and environmental change. Among the LCMAP product suite are annual land cover maps that will be available to the public. This paper describes an approach to optimize the selection of training and auxiliary data for deriving the thematic land cover maps based on all available clear observations from Landsats 4–8. Training data were selected from map products of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Land Cover Trends project. The Random Forest classifier was applied for different classification scenarios based on the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. We found that extracting training data proportionally to the occurrence of land cover classes was superior to an equal distribution of training data per class, and suggest using a total of 20,000 training pixels to classify an area about the size of a Landsat scene. The problem of unbalanced training data was alleviated by extracting a minimum of 600 training pixels and a maximum of 8000 training pixels per class. We additionally explored removing outliers contained within the training data based on their spectral and spatial criteria, but observed no significant improvement in classification results. We also tested the importance of different types of auxiliary data that were available for the conterminous United States, including: (a) five variables used by the National Land Cover Database, (b) three variables from the cloud screening “Function of mask” (Fmask) statistics, and (c) two variables from the change detection results of CCDC. We found that auxiliary variables such as a Digital Elevation Model and its derivatives (aspect, position index, and slope), potential wetland index, water probability, snow probability, and cloud probability improved the accuracy of land cover classification. Compared to the original strategy of the CCDC algorithm (500 pixels per class), the use of the optimal strategy improved the classification accuracies substantially (15-percentage point increase in overall accuracy and 4-percentage point increase in minimum accuracy).},
